# Exercises - Introduction to Python for Science (2015)

Some years ago I started to learn Python and this PDF by David J. Pine was some
of the first materials I used. By that time, I had never heard of git or GitHub.
 I decided to review some of my old codes and push them here so that other people
 can see them and to show them to my students.

The codes are almost as they were written by me at that time. In some cases I
upgrade them and maybe I will do some more changes.

The author transformed the PDF in a book that can be found at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Science-Engineering-Computational-Physics-ebook-dp-B07LB7QH1B/dp/B07LB7QH1B/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=).
I have not read it yet, but the first chapters seen to be almost the same as the
old PDF. However there are new chapters.

The text and exercises of the old PDF version are available online at the
[NYU site](https://physics.nyu.edu/pine/pymanual/html/pymanMaster.html).

There are some code and comments in Portuguese since I am from Brazil.
